For Project Milestone 2 the Snake game was divided into a Windows class in order to limit access to private variables.
The random number generator, various global variables, and certain inconsistencies in the provided code were fixed in
this version.  The class Windows served as an abstraction mechanism for creating the output game window, grouping the SFML
prebuilt functions (to create the window) into one area of code.
