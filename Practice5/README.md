Practice 5 eliminates the Game of War, bit shifting, and unions used in the previous assignments and transforms the code
to provide the ability to print a card, return the colour of the card, and query if the card is a standard or joker card.
The colour, suit, rank, and kind may all be returned, and the standard and joker card classes were represented in a hierarchical structure to meet the requirements of the practice assignment.
