This update to the game of war uses a compact binary representation that supports jokers and standard cards.  In addition
to the binary represenation of Practice 3, jokers are denoted by their colour.  Cards are denoted by their kind, and each card
is defined by eight bits.  This assignment also included the union PlayingCardUnion that can be found in origin/Practice4/Bits.
