This update to the game of war uses a tagged union to support jokers and standard cards.  The enums Colour and Kind
distinguish between what colour of joker and what kind of card, respectively.  The binary representations are left in
from the previous iteration of the game of war, although the joker card binary representations are not included in this 
iteration of the program.
